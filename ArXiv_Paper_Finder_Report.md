## INTRODUCTION
### Background & Current Trends
The growth of scientific research and publishing has created an overwhelming volume of academic papers, making it increasingly difficult for researchers to find the most relevant papers for their work. ArXiv.org, a popular open-access repository for electronic preprints, hosts over 2 million papers but offers limited search functionality and filtering options. The rise of AI-powered search and personalization tools in academic environments represents a significant trend that aims to address these challenges.

### Problem Statement
Standard academic paper repositories, including arXiv, offer basic search functionality that often returns too many irrelevant results, lacks specialized topic filtering, and requires users to manually download papers one at a time. Researchers waste valuable time sifting through search results and managing downloads rather than focusing on their actual research.

### Objectives
The ArXiv Paper Finder aims to:
1. Create an intuitive web interface for searching arXiv papers
2. Implement an intelligent relevance scoring system for search results
3. Provide specialized topic presets for common research areas
4. Enable batch downloading of multiple papers
5. Offer more flexible filtering options than the native arXiv interface

### Scope & Limitations
The application is currently focused on:
- Computer Science papers with emphasis on AI, cybersecurity, and related fields
- Integration with arXiv's public API only
- Frontend implementation with basic proxy for API calls
- Limited to 50 results per query (arXiv API limitation)

### Relevance to Real-World Problems
Researchers across academia and industry spend significant time seeking relevant literature, often navigating multiple repositories with different interfaces. By streamlining this process, the application addresses a genuine pain point in the research workflow, potentially saving hours of manual searching and downloading across multiple research sessions.

## METHODS
### Approach
The project was developed using a modern web application stack centered around Next.js and React. The application connects to arXiv's public API to fetch paper data and implements custom relevance scoring algorithms on the client side. The development followed a component-based architecture with separation of concerns between data fetching, processing, and presentation.

   - Category-based filtering with 40+ arXiv CS categories
   - Preset topic searches for specialized domains

2. **Relevance Scoring System**
   - Custom algorithm that evaluates paper relevance on a 0-10 scale
   - Keyword weighting for preset topics
   - Required and excluded keyword detection
   - Title-match boosting

3. **Results Filtering**
   - Filter by relevance score threshold
   - Visual indicators for relevance level
   - Expandable paper abstracts

4. **Batch Download System**
   - Selection of multiple papers
   - Single-click batch downloading
   - Background processing with progress tracking

5. **Responsive UI**
   - Mobile and desktop optimized layouts
   - Dark/light mode support

## DISCUSSION
### What Went Well
- The relevance scoring algorithm effectively prioritized truly relevant papers
- Integration with arXiv's API was smooth despite XML parsing requirements
- The UI design received positive feedback for clarity and ease of use
- Batch downloading functionality performed reliably

### What Was Difficult
- ArXiv API rate limiting occasionally caused delays during development testing
- Creating relevance algorithms that work well across different research domains was challenging
- Balancing search precision and recall required multiple iterations
- PDF downloading required proxy handling due to CORS restrictions

### How Results Compare to Expectations
The application met or exceeded most initial objectives. The relevance scoring system proved more effective than initially expected, while the batch download feature required more complexity to handle rate limiting and error states. The user interface evolved to be more intuitive based on early feedback, resulting in a system that more fully addressed user needs than originally anticipated.

### Improvements That Could Be Made
1. Implement user accounts for saving searches and paper collections
2. Add citation export in multiple formats (BibTeX, EndNote, etc.)
3. Integrate with additional paper repositories (IEEE, ACM, etc.)
4. Develop a recommendation system based on user interests
5. Add natural language processing for more sophisticated relevance scoring

### Interdisciplinary Challenges
The project required balancing web development with information retrieval concepts. Creating effective relevance scoring algorithms required understanding of both text analysis techniques and domain-specific knowledge in areas like cybersecurity and machine learning. This interdisciplinary nature added complexity but resulted in a more valuable end product.

### Ethical/Security Considerations
1. The application respects arXiv's API usage policies and rate limits
2. No user data is collected or stored beyond the current session
3. All paper access is through official arXiv channels, maintaining proper attribution
4. Search functionality avoids filter bubbles by providing options to view all results regardless of calculated relevance

## CONCLUSION
The ArXiv Paper Finder successfully addresses the challenges researchers face when searching for academic papers by providing intelligent relevance scoring, specialized filtering, and batch downloading capabilities. The application demonstrates that even without complex machine learning models, thoughtfully designed search algorithms and user interfaces can significantly improve the research workflow.

Future development could extend the platform to include more repositories, collaborative features, and machine learning-based recommendation systems.
